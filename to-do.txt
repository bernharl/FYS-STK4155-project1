- plot for bias and variance
- write report 	
- bias and variance for number of data points 
- generate all new plots and R2 scores for degree = 5 because we're dumb 
- decide which figures to include in the report
- decide on lambda values for ridge and lasso for both data sets 



SKIP POINT PROBLEM 

need to change: 
- name of existing terrain figures where the skip=150
- bias_variance terrain plots for skip=4
- r2 scores terrain for skip=4
- beta_variance terrain plot for skip=4
