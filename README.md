# FYS-STK4155 Project 1
This is our source code for Project 1 in the course FYS-STK4155 Applied Data Analysis and Machine Learning at the University of Oslo.

The project is based on various introductory regression methods and resampling. 
We will be using the following regression methods,
1. Ordinary Least Squares 
2. Ridge
3. Lasso

in combination with our own implementation of k-fold cross-validation in order to eventually model a two-dimensional polynomial fit to real terrain data downloaded from [USGS EarthExplorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/).

To run all test functions, generate data and plots used in the report, please run main_script.sh.

## 3D plot of Franke's function fit with Ridge regression
As mentioned in section 5.1 in the report, the 3D plot of the Ridge fit of Franke's function can be found [here](/doc/figs/3dmodel_Ridge_Franke.pdf).
